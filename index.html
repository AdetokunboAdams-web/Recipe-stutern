    <h1>Jollof rice</h1>
    <p>The origins of jollof rice can be traced to the Senegambian region that was ruled by the Wolof or Jolof Empire in the 14th century, spanning parts of today's Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania, where rice was grown. The dish has its roots in a traditional dish called thieboudienne, containing rice, fish, shellfish and vegetables.</p>

    <h3>How to prepare Jollof rice</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Wash your rice and set aside.</li>
      <li>Place a pot on heat, add oil into the pot, then add in sliced onions.
       Sautee the onions till they are fragrant and translucent.
       This should take about 2 minutes. </li>
      <li>Add in the blended peppers, curry powder, dried thyme, seasoning cubes,
         and salt. Fry till it is dark red and no longer raw. It will be reduced in quantity,
         thick and the oil floats to the top of the sauce. This takes about 10 - 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add boiling water. Stir, add in the washed rice. Cover the pot tightly and cook the rice on low heat till it's almost tender. (About 25 minutes).</li>
      <li>Few minutes into the cooking, add the remaining sliced onion and sliced tomato</li>
      <li>Cover the pot and continue to steam the rice till it's tender.</li>
      <li>Stir and serve</li>
    </ol>
